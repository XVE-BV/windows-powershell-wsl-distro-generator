# Laravel Sail + Nginx Proxy Manager - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
You were experiencing issues with nginx-proxy-manager ports configuration for your Laravel Sail project. The original configuration had port conflicts and networking issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Corrected nginx-proxy-manager-compose.yml
**Changes made:**
- HTTP port: `8080:80` (avoids system conflicts)
- Admin interface: `8181:81` (avoids conflicts with other services)
- HTTPS port: `8443:443` (doesn't require admin privileges)
- Added `extra_hosts` with `host-gateway` for proper container communication

### 2. Key Configuration Details

**Nginx Proxy Manager Ports:**
- Main proxy: `http://localhost:8080`
- Admin panel: `http://localhost:8181`
- HTTPS proxy: `https://localhost:8443`

**Laravel Sail Configuration:**
- Your app runs on port `48080` (from APP_PORT in .env)
- Nginx Proxy Manager forwards traffic from port `8080` to your app on `48080`

## Required Changes to Your Laravel Project

### 1. Update your .env file
```env
# Change this line:
APP_URL=http://sail-test-project.test

# To this (for HTTP through proxy):
APP_URL=http://sail-test-project.test:8080

# Or this (for HTTPS after SSL setup):
APP_URL=https://sail-test-project.test:8443
```

### 2. Your hosts file entry is correct
```
127.0.0.1 sail-test-project.test
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Copy the corrected files to your Laravel project
Copy these files to your Laravel project directory:
- `nginx-proxy-manager-compose.yml`
- `nginx-proxy-manager-setup.md`

### 2. Start both services
```bash
# Start Laravel Sail
./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# Start Nginx Proxy Manager
docker-compose -f nginx-proxy-manager-compose.yml up -d
```

### 3. Configure the proxy
1. Access admin panel: `http://localhost:8181`
2. Login with default credentials (admin@example.com / changeme)
3. Add proxy host:
   - Domain: `sail-test-project.test`
   - Forward to: `host.docker.internal:48080`

### 4. Test the setup
- Direct access: `http://localhost:48080` (Laravel Sail)
- Proxied access: `http://sail-test-project.test:8080` (through Nginx Proxy Manager)

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Port Separation**: Nginx Proxy Manager uses different ports (8080, 8181, 8443) that don't conflict with your Laravel Sail setup
2. **Host Gateway**: Uses `host-gateway` to allow the proxy container to reach your Laravel app
3. **Proper Forwarding**: Forwards traffic from the proxy to your Laravel app on port 48080
4. **Domain Resolution**: Your hosts file entry works with the proxy configuration

## Benefits

- Clean URLs: `http://sail-test-project.test:8080` instead of `http://localhost:48080`
- SSL termination: Easy HTTPS setup through Nginx Proxy Manager
- Multiple projects: Can proxy multiple Laravel projects with different domains
- Professional setup: Mimics production reverse proxy configurations

## Next Steps

1. Copy the files to your Laravel project
2. Update your .env APP_URL
3. Follow the setup instructions in `nginx-proxy-manager-setup.md`
4. Test both direct and proxied access to ensure everything works
