echo "1. Verifying Dockerfile sets permissions correctly:"
echo "   - Dockerfile line 45: chmod +x /usr/local/bin/patch-manager.sh /usr/local/bin/selfupdate"
echo "   - This ensures both scripts are executable after build"
echo

echo "2. Testing selfupdate script behavior:"
echo "   - No runtime permission checking needed"
echo "   - Simple log message about Dockerfile handling permissions"
echo "   - Direct execution of patch-manager without permission concerns"
